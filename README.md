## PlantAPI
REST API for [PlantApp](https://github.com/Endrju00/plantapp) which facilitates the care of plants. Users can add their plants and the conditions in which they can stay and how they should be cared for. The application reminds you to water the plants and also helps when you leave the plant to someone to care for.
